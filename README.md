# UFOs
Creating dynamic tables using JavaScript and HTML

## Purpose
The goal of this project was to take data compiled about UFO sightings and build a dynamic table on a webpage that will neatly display the information for the users. This table will also include a filtering function that will allow the user to further refine their search and see data pertinent to thier interest.

## Results
### Using the webpage
When the user first comes to the webpage they will see the header, a breif introductory paragraph, and then the table displayed below. The table at this point displays all of the data, because no filters have beein applied. On the left-hand side of the table are the filter categories. Each filter box shows an example for each filter criteria.

#### Using the search criteria
The table displays the data sorted by the following column headers: Date, State, Country, Shape, Duration, and Comments. This filters allow for the user to type in their search criteria under the appropriate section.

)

When the user enters a valid option into any of the filters, the table repopulates with the desired criteria. ![](https://github.com/chichi-ugo/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/example_search.PNG?raw=true) If an invalid input is typed in, the table will return as empty. ![](https://github.com/chichi-ugo/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/invalid_search.PNG?raw=true)

To return the table to the original, simply remove any inputs from the filters.
